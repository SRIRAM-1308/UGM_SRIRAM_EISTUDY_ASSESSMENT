EI Study Assessment , by Uppuganti Gowri Mallikharjuna Sriram - BL.EN.U4EAC20082

Want to say a few words about my experience solving this assessment . I've learnt some new techniques,terms while working on this assessment. I've learnt a lot from this assessment and I would be honoured if get the chance to get interviewed and get selected for the company and work for the company and learn many more things and grow my expertise.

I thank the team of EI Study for giving me the chance of attempting this assessment through which I learnt a few new things and upgraded my skills by a little bit.
